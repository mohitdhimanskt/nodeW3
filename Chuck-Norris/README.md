Exercise 1: Chuck Norris programs do not accept input

Did you know that there is an API for Chuck Norris jokes? That's incredible, right!?

Write a small JavaScript function that calls this API The Internet Chuck Norris Databases and prints a random joke to the console. You'll be using the node command to execute the JavaScript file.

Follow the steps:

    In /homework/nodejs-exercises, initialize NPM (using the correct command in the command line)
    Create a JavaScript file that will hold the code for your program, called norris-jokes.js
    Install node-fetch
    Require node-fetch in norris-jokes.js
    Write a function called getNorrisJoke
    GET a random joke inside the function, using the API: http://www.icndb.com/api/
    Make use of async/await and try/catch
    Print the joke to the console

Hints:

    First, print the entire response to the console to see how it is structured.
